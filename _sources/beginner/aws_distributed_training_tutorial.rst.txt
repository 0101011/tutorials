PyTorch 1.0 Distributed Trainer with Amazon AWS
===============================================

**Author**: `Nathan Inkawhich <https://github.com/inkawhich>`_

**Edited by**: `Teng Li <https://github.com/teng-li>`_



In this tutorial we will show how to setup, code, and run a PyTorch 1.0
distributed trainer across two multi-gpu Amazon AWS nodes. We will start
with describing the AWS setup, then the PyTorch environment
configuration, and finally the code for the distributed trainer.
Hopefully you will find that there is actually very little code change
required to extend your current training code to a distributed
application, and most of the work is in the one-time environment setup.



Amazon AWS Setup
----------------

In this tutorial we will run distributed training across two multi-gpu
nodes. In this section we will first cover how to create the nodes, then
how to setup the security group so the nodes can communicate with
eachother.

Creating the Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Amazon AWS, there are seven steps to creating an instance. To get
started, login and select **Launch Instance**.

**Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** - Here we will select
the ``Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu) Version 14.0``. As described, this
instance comes with many of the most popular deep learning frameworks
installed and is preconfigured with CUDA, cuDNN, and NCCL. It is a very
good starting point for this tutorial.

**Step 2: Choose an Instance Type** - Now, select the GPU compute unit
called ``p2.8xlarge``. Notice, each of these instances has a different
cost but this instance provides 8 NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs per node, and
provides a good architecture for multi-gpu distributed training.

**Step 3: Configure Instance Details** - The only setting to change here
is increasing the *Number of instances* to 2. All other configurations
may be left at default.

**Step 4: Add Storage** - Notice, by default these nodes do not come
with a lot of storage (only 75 GB). For this tutorial, since we are only
using the STL-10 dataset, this is plenty of storage. But, if you want to
train on a larger dataset such as ImageNet, you will have to add much
more storage just to fit the dataset and any trained models you wish to
save.

**Step 5: Add Tags** - Nothing to be done here, just move on.

**Step 6: Configure Security Group** - This is a critical step in the
configuration process. By default two nodes in the same security group
would not be able to communicate in the distributed training setting.
Here, we want to create a **new** security group for the two nodes to be
in. However, we cannot finish configuring in this step. For now, just
remember your new security group name (e.g. launch-wizard-12) then move
on to Step 7.

**Step 7: Review Instance Launch** - Here, review the instance then
launch it. By default, this will automatically start initializing the
two instances. You can monitor the initialization progress from the
dashboard.

Configure Security Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recall that we were not able to properly configure the security group
when creating the instances. Once you have launched the instance, select
the *Network & Security > Security Groups* tab in the EC2 dashboard.
This will bring up a list of security groups you have access to. Select
the new security group you created in Step 6 (i.e. launch-wizard-12),
which will bring up tabs called *Description, Inbound, Outbound, and
Tags*. First, select the *Inbound* tab and *Edit* to add a rule to allow
"All Traffic" from "Sources" in the launch-wizard-12 security group.
Then select the *Outbound* tab and do the exact same thing. Now, we have
effectively allowed all Inbound and Outbound traffic of all types
between nodes in the launch-wizard-12 security group.

Necessary Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before continuing, we must find and remember the IP addresses of both
nodes. In the EC2 dashboard find your running instances. For both
instances, write down the *IPv4 Public IP* and the *Private IPs*. For
the remainder of the document, we will refer to these as the
**node0-publicIP**, **node0-privateIP**, **node1-publicIP**, and
**node1-privateIP**. The public IPs are the addresses we will use to SSH
in, and the private IPs will be used for inter-node communication.



Environment Setup
-----------------

The next critical step is the setup of each node. Unfortunately, we
cannot configure both nodes at the same time, so this process must be
done on each node separately. However, this is a one time setup, so once
you have the nodes configured properly you will not have to reconfigure
for future distributed training projects.

The first step, once logged onto the node, is to create a new conda
environment with python 3.6 and numpy. Once created activate the
environment.

::

    $ conda create -n nightly_pt python=3.6 numpy
    $ source activate nightly_pt

Next, we will install a nightly build of Cuda 9.0 enabled PyTorch with
pip in the conda environment.

::

    $ pip install torch_nightly -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu90/torch_nightly.html

We must also install torchvision so we can use the torchvision model and
dataset. At this time, we must build torchvision from source as the pip
installation will by default install an old version of PyTorch on top of
the nightly build we just installed.

::

    $ cd
    $ git clone https://github.com/pytorch/vision.git
    $ cd vision
    $ python setup.py install

And finally, **VERY IMPORTANT** step is to set the network interface
name for the NCCL socket. This is set with the environment variable
``NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME``. To get the correct name, run the ``ifconfig``
command on the node and look at the interface name that corresponds to
the node's *privateIP* (e.g. ens3). Then set the environment variable as

::

    $ export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=ens3

Remember, do this on both nodes. You may also consider adding the
NCCL\_SOCKET\_IFNAME setting to your *.bashrc*. An important observation
is that we did not setup a shared filesystem between the nodes.
Therefore, each node will have to have a copy of the code and a copy of
the datasets. For more information about setting up a shared network
filesystem between nodes, see
`here <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-elastic-file-system-shared-file-storage-for-amazon-ec2/>`__.



Distributed Training Code
-------------------------

With the instances running and the environments setup we can now get
into the training code. Most of the code here has been taken from the
`PyTorch ImageNet
Example <https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet>`__
which also supports distributed training. This code provides a good
starting point for a custom trainer as it has much of the boilerplate
training loop, validation loop, and accuracy tracking functionality.
However, you will notice that the argument parsing and other
non-essential functions have been stripped out for simplicity.

In this example we will use
`torchvision.models.resnet18 <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html#torchvision.models.resnet18>`__
model and will train it on the
`torchvision.datasets.STL10 <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#torchvision.datasets.STL10>`__
dataset. To accomodate for the dimensionality mismatch of STL-10 with
Resnet18, we will resize each image to 224x224 with a transform. Notice,
the choice of model and dataset are orthogonal to the distributed
training code, you may use any dataset and model you wish and the
process is the same. Lets get started by first handling the imports and
talking about some helper functions. Then we will define the train and
test functions, which have been largely taken from the ImageNet Example.
At the end, we will build the main part of the code which handles the
distributed training setup. And finally, we will discuss how to actually
run the code.



Imports
~~~~~~~

The important distributed training specific imports here are
`torch.nn.parallel <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel>`__,
`torch.distributed <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html>`__,
`torch.utils.data.distributed <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.distributed.DistributedSampler>`__,
and
`torch.multiprocessing <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/multiprocessing.html>`__.
It is also important to set the multiprocessing start method to *spawn*
or *forkserver* (only supported in Python 3),
as the default is *fork* which may cause deadlocks when using multiple
worker processes for dataloading.



Helper Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We must also define some helper functions and classes that will make
training easier. The ``AverageMeter`` class tracks training statistics
like accuracy and iteration count. The ``accuracy`` function computes
and returns the top-k accuracy of the model so we can track learning
progress. Both are provided for training convenience but neither are
distributed training specific.



Train Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To simplify the main loop, it is best to separate a training epoch step
into a function called ``train``. This function trains the input model
for one epoch of the *train\_loader*. The only distributed training
artifact in this function is setting the
`non\_blocking <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#use-pinned-memory-buffers>`__
attributes of the data and label tensors to ``True`` before the forward
pass. This allows asynchronous GPU copies of the data meaning transfers
can be overlapped with computation. This function also outputs training
statistics along the way so we can track progress throughout the epoch.

The other function to define here is ``adjust_learning_rate``, which
decays the initial learning rate at a fixed schedule. This is another
boilerplate trainer function that is useful to train accurate models.



Validation Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To track generalization performance and simplify the main loop further
we can also extract the validation step into a function called
``validate``. This function runs a full validation step of the input
model on the input validation dataloader and returns the top-1 accuracy
of the model on the validation set. Again, you will notice the only
distributed training feature here is setting ``non_blocking=True`` for
the training data and labels before they are passed to the model.



Inputs
~~~~~~

With the helper functions out of the way, now we have reached the
interesting part. Here is where we will define the inputs for the run.
Some of the inputs are standard model training inputs such as batch size
and number of training epochs, and some are specific to our distributed
training task. The required inputs are:

-  **batch\_size** - batch size for *each* process in the distributed
   training group. Total batch size across distributed model is
   batch\_size\*world\_size

-  **workers** - number of worker processes used with the dataloaders in
   each process

-  **num\_epochs** - total number of epochs to train for

-  **starting\_lr** - starting learning rate for training

-  **world\_size** - number of processes in the distributed training
   environment

-  **dist\_backend** - backend to use for distributed training
   communication (i.e. NCCL, Gloo, MPI, etc.). In this tutorial, since
   we are using several multi-gpu nodes, NCCL is suggested.

-  **dist\_url** - URL to specify the initialization method of the
   process group. This may contain the IP address and port of the rank0
   process or be a non-existant file on a shared file system. Here,
   since we do not have a shared file system this will incorporate the
   **node0-privateIP** and the port on node0 to use.




.. code-block:: python




    # Batch Size for training and testing


    # Number of additional worker processes for dataloading


    # Number of epochs to train for


    # Starting Learning Rate


    # Number of distributed processes


    # Distributed backend type


    # Url used to setup distributed training









Initialize process group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the most important parts of distributed training in PyTorch is to
properly setup the process group, which is the **first** step in
initializing the ``torch.distributed`` package. To do this, we will use
the ``torch.distributed.init_process_group`` function which takes
several inputs. First, a *backend* input which specifies the backend to
use (i.e. NCCL, Gloo, MPI, etc.). An *init\_method* input which is
either a url containing the address and port of the rank0 machine or a
path to a non-existant file on the shared file system. Note, to use the
file init\_method, all machines must have access to the file, similarly
for the url method, all machines must be able to communicate on the
network so make sure to configure any firewalls and network settings to
accomodate. The *init\_process\_group* function also takes *rank* and
*world\_size* arguments which specify the rank of this process when run
and the number of processes in the collective, respectively.
The *init\_method* input can also be "env://". In this case, the address
and port of the rank0 machine will be read from the following two
environment variables respectively: MASTER_ADDR, MASTER_PORT.  If *rank*
and *world\_size* arguments are not specified in the *init\_process\_group*
function, they both can be read from the following two environment
variables respectively as well: RANK, WORLD_SIZE.

Another important step, especially when each node has multiple gpus is
to set the *local\_rank* of this process. For example, if you have two
nodes, each with 8 GPUs and you wish to train with all of them then
:math:`world\_size=16` and each node will have a process with local rank
0-7. This local\_rank is used to set the device (i.e. which GPU to use)
for the process and later used to set the device when creating a
distributed data parallel model. It is also recommended to use NCCL
backend in this hypothetical environment as NCCL is preferred for
multi-gpu nodes.




.. code-block:: python



    # Initialize Process Group
    # v1 - init with url

    # v2 - init with file
    # dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl", init_method="file:///home/ubuntu/pt-distributed-tutorial/trainfile", rank=int(sys.argv[1]), world_size=world_size)
    # v3 - init with environment variables
    # dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl", init_method="env://", rank=int(sys.argv[1]), world_size=world_size)


    # Establish Local Rank and set device on this node











Initialize Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next major step is to initialize the model to be trained. Here, we
will use a resnet18 model from ``torchvision.models`` but any model may
be used. First, we initialize the model and place it in GPU memory.
Next, we make the model ``DistributedDataParallel``, which handles the
distribution of the data to and from the model and is critical for
distributed training. The ``DistributedDataParallel`` module also
handles the averaging of gradients across the world, so we do not have
to explicitly average the gradients in the training step.

It is important to note that this is a blocking function, meaning
program execution will wait at this function until *world\_size*
processes have joined the process group. Also, notice we pass our device
ids list as a parameter which contains the local rank (i.e. GPU) we are
using. Finally, we specify the loss function and optimizer to train the
model with.




.. code-block:: python



    # Construct Model

    # Make model DistributedDataParallel


    # define loss function (criterion) and optimizer










Initialize Dataloaders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The last step in preparation for the training is to specify which
dataset to use. Here we use the `STL-10
dataset <https://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/>`__ from
`torchvision.datasets.STL10 <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#torchvision.datasets.STL10>`__.
The STL10 dataset is a 10 class dataset of 96x96px color images. For use
with our model, we resize the images to 224x224px in the transform. One
distributed training specific item in this section is the use of the
``DistributedSampler`` for the training set, which is designed to be
used in conjunction with ``DistributedDataParallel`` models. This object
handles the partitioning of the dataset across the distributed
environment so that not all models are training on the same subset of
data, which would be counterproductive. Finally, we create the
``DataLoader``'s which are responsible for feeding the data to the
processes.

The STL-10 dataset will automatically download on the nodes if they are
not present. If you wish to use your own dataset you should download the
data, write your own dataset handler, and construct a dataloader for
your dataset here.




.. code-block:: python



    # Define the transform for the data. Notice, we must resize to 224x224 with this dataset and model.





    # Initialize Datasets. STL10 will automatically download if not present



    # Create DistributedSampler to handle distributing the dataset across nodes when training
    # This can only be called after torch.distributed.init_process_group is called


    # Create the Dataloaders to feed data to the training and validation steps










Training Loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The last step is to define the training loop. We have already done most
of the work for setting up the distributed training so this is not
distributed training specific. The only detail is setting the current
epoch count in the ``DistributedSampler``, as the sampler shuffles the
data going to each process deterministically based on epoch. After
updating the sampler, the loop runs a full training epoch, runs a full
validation step then prints the performance of the current model against
the best performing model so far. After training for num\_epochs, the
loop exits and the tutorial is complete. Notice, since this is an
exercise we are not saving models but one may wish to keep track of the
best performing model then save it at the end of training (see
`here <https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/imagenet/main.py#L184>`__).



Running the Code
----------------

Unlike most of the other PyTorch tutorials, this code may not be run
directly out of this notebook. To run, download the .py version of this
file (or convert it using
`this <https://gist.github.com/chsasank/7218ca16f8d022e02a9c0deb94a310fe>`__)
and upload a copy to both nodes. The astute reader would have noticed
that we hardcoded the **node0-privateIP** and :math:`world\_size=4` but
input the *rank* and *local\_rank* inputs as arg[1] and arg[2] command
line arguments, respectively. Once uploaded, open two ssh terminals into
each node.

-  On the first terminal for node0, run ``$ python main.py 0 0``

-  On the second terminal for node0 run ``$ python main.py 1 1``

-  On the first terminal for node1, run ``$ python main.py 2 0``

-  On the second terminal for node1 run ``$ python main.py 3 1``

The programs will start and wait after printing "Initialize Model..."
for all four processes to join the process group. Notice the first
argument is not repeated as this is the unique global rank of the
process. The second argument is repeated as that is the local rank of
the process running on the node. If you run ``nvidia-smi`` on each node,
you will see two processes on each node, one running on GPU0 and one on
GPU1.

We have now completed the distributed training example! Hopefully you
can see how you would use this tutorial to help train your own models on
your own datasets, even if you are not using the exact same distributed
envrionment. If you are using AWS, don't forget to **SHUT DOWN YOUR
NODES** if you are not using them or you may find an uncomfortably large
bill at the end of the month.

**Where to go next**

-  Check out the `launcher
   utility <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#launch-utility>`__
   for a different way of kicking off the run

-  Check out the `torch.multiprocessing.spawn
   utility <https://pytorch.org/docs/master/multiprocessing.html#spawning-subprocesses>`__
   for another easy way of kicking off multiple distributed processes.
   `PyTorch ImageNet Example <https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet>`__
   has it implemented and can demonstrate how to use it.

-  If possible, setup a NFS so you only need one copy of the dataset
